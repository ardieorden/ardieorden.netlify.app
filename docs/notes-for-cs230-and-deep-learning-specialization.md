# Notes for CS230 and Deep Learning Specialization

I'm watching the lectures from [Autumn 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOABXSygHTsbvUz4G_YQhOb) and the modules from 2017 (Course [1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0), [2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc), [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b), [4](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF)).

- Deep learning is popular because of the increase in data and the increase in compute.
- CS230 and other machine learning CS courses from Stanford are self-contained; it's not a strict requirement to take one before anotther.

- One unique part of this course is "Structuring your Machine Learning project" since it's not usually taught. However, since Andrew Ng worked at Google and Baidu, he feels compelled to teach it since he has lots of real-world lessons that he wants to teach.

- ReLU or Rectified Linear Unit is a function that only gives 0 or positive numbers.
